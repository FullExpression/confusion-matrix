In the command line, run the following command `npm install @fullexpression/confusion-matrix`.

*You can find all npm package versions [here](https://github.com/FullExpression/confusion-matrix/packages/630932/versions)*.

    imports: [...],
    providers: [...],
    bootstrap: [...]
})
export class YourApplicationModule { }
```

2. Create a new `ConfusionMatrix` object:

```typescript

@Component(...)
export class MyComponent {
    confusionMatrix = new ConfusionMatrix({
        labels: ["Happiness", "Sadness"], 
        matrix: [[50, 2],
                [8, 50]]
    });
}

```

3. Import `ConfusionMatrix` component to your html and pass the confusion `confusionMatrix` object created in the step before:

```html
<confusion-matrix [confusionMatrix]="confusionMatrix"></confusion-matrix>
```
